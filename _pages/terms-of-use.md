CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

1. **Disputes and Arbitration.**

a. Disputes. For all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to the Waga Service, you must first send a written description of your claim to WAGA LLC to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You and WAGA LLC each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If we still cannot resolve the dispute you may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within 60 days. Please read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights. It provides for resolution of disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited. Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This arbitration clause shall survive termination of the Terms.

b. Governing Law. By using the Waga Service, you agree that the statutes and laws of the United States without regard to conflicts of laws principles, will apply to all matters relating to use of the Waga Service. If we are unable to commence arbitration, you agree that any litigation shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts in New York, NY and shall be subject to the laws of New York without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.

c. Arbitration Procedures.

1. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising in any way out of or in connection with the Terms (including, without limitation: (1) any contractual, pre-contractual or non-contractual rights, obligations or liabilities; and (2) any issue as to the existence, validity or termination of the Terms) shall be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“ICDR”) in accordance with its International Arbitration Rules in force as at the date of this Agreement (the “Rules”), which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Section 19 and as may be amended by the rest of this Section 19.
2. The arbitration tribunal (“Tribunal”) shall consist of three (3) arbitrators. The claimant shall designate one (1) arbitrator. The respondent shall designate one (1) arbitrator. The two arbitrators thus appointed shall designate the third arbitrator who shall be the presiding arbitrator. If within fourteen (14) days of a request from the other party to do so a party fails to designate an arbitrator, or if the two arbitrators fail to designate the third arbitrator within fourteen (14) days after the confirmation of appointment of the second arbitrator, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the ICDR in accordance with the Rules.
3. The seat of the arbitration shall be New York, New York, U.S.A. The language of the arbitration shall be English. This arbitration clause shall be governed by the laws of the United States, including the Federal Arbitration Act, and to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of New York (United States).
4. Any award of the Tribunal shall be made in writing and shall be final and binding on the parties from the day it is made. The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall be empowered to award only those damages which are permitted by the Terms, subject to any disclaimers of damages and liability limits set forth in thee Terms, but the arbitrator or arbitrators shall not have the authority to reform, modify or materially change the Terms. The award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The parties hereby irrevocably waive their right to any form of appeal, review or recourse to any court or other judicial authority insofar as such waiver may be validly made. The parties waive any right to apply to any court and/or other judicial authority to determine any preliminary point of law and/or review any question of law and/or the merits, insofar as such waiver may validly be made. The parties shall not be deemed, however, to have waived any other right to challenge any award.
5. The parties agree that the arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to issue interim orders for provisional relief, including, but not limited to, orders for injunctive relief, attachment or other provisional remedy, as necessary to protect either party’s name, proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how or any other proprietary right. The parties agree that any interim order of the arbitrator(s) for any injunctive or other preliminary relief shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, nothing in the Terms shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking provisional relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, in order to protect that party’s name or proprietary rights. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as preventing any party from seeking conservatory or interim relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, including without limitation to protect either party’s name, proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how or any other proprietary rights.



1. **Miscellaneous**.

a. Waiver. A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. The failure of any party at any time to require performance of any provision of these Terms shall in no manner affect such party’s right at a later time to enforce the same. A waiver of any breach of any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of the same or other provisions of these Terms.

b. Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

c. Assignment. The Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by WAGA without restriction.

d. Survival. Sections 4, 6, 8(b), 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 will survive any termination of these Terms.

e. Headings. The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

f. Entire Agreement. These Terms are the entire agreement between you and WAGA relating to the subject matter herein and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to these Terms made by WAGA as set forth in Section 4.

g. CLAIMS. YOU AND WAGA AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO Waga Service MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
